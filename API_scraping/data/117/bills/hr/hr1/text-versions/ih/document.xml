In 2020, according to the Sentencing Project, an estimated 5,200,000 Americans could not vote due to a felony conviction. One in 16 African Americans of voting age is disenfranchised, a rate 3.7 times greater than that of non-African Americans. In seven States–Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wyoming–more than one in seven African Americans is disenfranchised, twice the national average for African Americans. Congress finds that felony disenfranchisement was one of the tools of intentional racial discrimination during the Jim Crow era. Congress further finds that current racial disparities in felony disenfranchisement are linked to this history of voter suppression, structural racism in the criminal justice system, and ongoing effects of historical discrimination.</text></subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="HCCBF426EE54B457191AB0025358ED68C"><enum>(5)</enum><subparagraph commented="no" display-inline="yes-display-inline" id="HF471201710CE4F49A7E4AF0D7C211D76"><enum>(A)</enum><text>Congress finds that it further has the power to protect the right to vote from denial or abridgment on account of sex, age, or ability to pay a poll tax or other tax pursuant to the Nineteenth, Twenty-Fourth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HAD39E28DC08640FD85B0604F4E0D8A21" indent="up1"><enum>(B)</enum><text>Congress finds that electoral practices including voting rights restoration conditions for people with convictions, voter identification requirements, and other restrictions to the franchise burden voters on account of their ability to pay.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H0FBBC5582F84442BA8F5F838B974162A" indent="up1"><enum>(C)</enum><text>Congress further finds that electoral practices including voting restrictions related to college campuses, age restrictions on mail voting, and similar practices burden the right to vote on account of age.</text></subparagraph></paragraph></section><section id="H3D984483A4A9453399601C5F72A9101D"><enum>4.</enum><header>Standards for judicial review</header><subsection id="HF25DB22AB1804C10BB29A45796422FBC"><enum>(a)</enum><header>In general</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">If any action is brought for declaratory or injunctive relief to challenge, whether facially or as-applied, the constitutionality of any provision of this Act or any amendment made by this Act or any rule or regulation promulgated under this Act, the following rules shall apply:</text><paragraph id="HE0C0BB60BF914B6E902314B78264B035"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The action shall be filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and an appeal from the decision of the district court may be taken to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H730F0929264F4279BAFEBAF0CF131C8D"><enum>(2)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The party filing the action shall concurrently deliver a copy the complaint to the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H77E3640DA04A4550827CE98EA8646636"><enum>(3)</enum><text>It shall be the duty of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and the Supreme Court of the United States to advance on the docket and to expedite to the greatest possible extent the disposition of the action and appeal.</text></paragraph></subsection><subsection id="H2D987C3084FA45D6ADCDCE15C18C829E"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Intervention by Members of Congress</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In any action described in subsection (a), any Member of the House of Representatives (including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the Congress) or Senate shall have the right to intervene either in support of or opposition to the position of a party to the case regarding the constitutionality of the provision.

By contrast, 75 percent of the disenfranchised reside in their communities while on probation or parole or after having completed their sentences. Approximately 2,200,000 citizens who have completed their sentences remain disenfranchised due to restrictive State laws.

They increase robust debate from diverse voices, enhance the responsiveness of elected officeholders, and help prevent corruption. They do not censor anyone’s speech but simply ensure that no one’s speech is drowned out.

Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310 (2010) and McCutcheon v. FEC, 572 U.S. 185 (2014), as well as other court decisions, erroneously invalidated even-handed rules about the spending of money in local, State, and Federal elections. These rules do not prevent anyone from speaking their mind, much less pick winners and losers of political debates. Although the Court has upheld other content-neutral laws like these, it has failed to apply to same logic to campaign finance laws. These flawed decisions have empowered large corporations, extremely wealthy individuals, and special interests to dominate election spending, corrupt our politics, and degrade our democracy through tidal waves of unlimited and anonymous spending. These decisions also stand in contrast to a long history of efforts by Congress and the States to regulate money in politics to protect democracy, and they illustrate a troubling deregulatory trend in campaign finance-related court decisions. Additionally, an unknown amount of foreign money continues to be spent in our political system as subsidiaries of foreign-based corporations and hostile foreign actors sometimes connected to nation-states work to influence our elections.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H921D4AABA0E34008AAFA1B0CA8F02352" commented="no"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The Supreme Court’s misinterpretation of the Constitution to empower monied interests at the expense of the American people in elections has seriously eroded over 100 years of congressional action to promote fairness and protect elections from the toxic influence of money.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HDCD83F70DD8048F4BD1D2C484500B44B" commented="no"><enum>(6)</enum><text>In 1907, Congress passed the Tillman Act in response to the concentration of corporate power in the post-Civil War Gilded Age.

Spending by outside groups nearly doubled again from 2016 to 2020 with super PACs, tax-exempt groups, and others spending more than $3,000,000,000. And as political entities adapt to a post-Citizens United, post-McCutcheon landscape, these trends are getting worse, as evidenced by the record-setting 2020 elections which cost more than $14,000,000,000 in total.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD26E5EE27014478DBF4F1CA834BE1F4D" commented="no"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Since the landmark Citizens United decision, 21 States and more than 800 municipalities, including large cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia, have gone on record supporting a constitutional amendment.

More broadly, the Court has severely curtailed attempts to reduce the ability of the Nation’s wealthiest and most powerful to skew our democracy in their favor by buying outsized influence in our elections.

While the law seems neutral, its actual effect is to privilege the independently wealthy who want to run, because given the demands of running for office, candidates who must work to pay for childcare or to afford health insurance are effectively being left out of the process, even if they have sufficient support to mount a viable campaign.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H497C2EB30782485385364AE4E27B72FD"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Thus current practice favors those prospective candidates who do not need to rely on a regular paycheck to make ends meet. The consequence is that everyday Americans who have firsthand knowledge of the importance of stable childcare, a safety net, or great public schools are less likely to get a seat at the table. This governance by the few is antithetical to the democratic experiment, but most importantly, when lawmakers do not share the concerns of everyday Americans, their policies reflect that.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HC27D997549DB4829A27A51F3EE959BDF"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">These circumstances have contributed to a Congress that does not always reflect everyday Americans. The New York Times reported in 2019 that fewer than 5 percent of representatives cite blue-collar or service jobs in their biographies. A 2015 survey by the Center for Responsive Politics showed that the median net worth of lawmakers was just over $1 million in 2013, or 18 times the wealth of the typical American household.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H5F8570C40243481992A09F086E755A3B"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">These circumstances have also contributed to a governing body that does not reflect the nation it serves. For instance, women are 51 percent of the American population. Yet even with a record number of women serving in the One Hundred Sixteenth Congress, the Pew Research Center notes that more than three out of four Members of this Congress are male. The Center for American Women And Politics found that one third of women legislators surveyed had been actively discouraged from running for office, often by political professionals. This type of discouragement, combined with the prohibitions on using campaign funds for domestic needs like childcare, burdens that still fall disproportionately on American women, particularly disadvantages working mothers. These barriers may explain why only 10 women in history have given birth while serving in Congress, in spite of the prevalence of working parents in other professions. Yet working mothers and fathers are best positioned to create policy that reflects the lived experience of most Americans.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HC3694109618B4990BEDF5F320E9D7C0B"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Working mothers, those caring for their elderly parents, and young professionals who rely on their jobs for health insurance should have the freedom to run to serve the people of the United States.

representatives who more accurately reflect the experiences, challenges, and ideals of everyday Americans.</text></subsection></section><section id="HE79248D283544DAFBB4444571C54BA55"
