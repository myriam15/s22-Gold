Shortly thereafter, those same supporters engaged in mass riots and insurrection on the grounds of the United States Capitol, leading to the breach and destruction of the Capitol building while Congress was in session conducting legislative business, as well as the death of at least five individuals, including a Capitol Police officer. The siege of the United States Capitol at the hands of Donald J. Trump created widespread terror, threatened the lives of members of the United States Congress, completely disrupted legislative business, threatened the continuity of government, and exposed the United States to grave national security risks. </text></subsection>

Trump has failed to divest his ownership stakes in, or meaningfully separate himself from, the Trump Organization’s vast network of business holdings, which engage with foreign governments. Through those business holdings, Donald J. Trump has received, and continues to receive, presents and emoluments, either directly or indirectly, from foreign governments. His receipt of presents and emoluments from foreign states creates both a conflict of interest between his personal business interests and his responsibilities as President of the United States, and an appearance that he is beholden to the foreign states from which he received the emoluments. </text></subsection>
