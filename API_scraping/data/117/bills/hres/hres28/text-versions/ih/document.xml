Biden, Jr., had secured the necessary number of electoral votes to be declared President-elect, President Trump, his legal representatives, and dozens of Republican Members of Congress and Senators deliberately attempted to reverse the results of the election in various States and to disenfranchise millions of voters by bringing forth frivolous lawsuits at several levels of the United States judicial system;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas due to an utter lack of evidence and legal standing, these lawsuits were swiftly dismissed by dozens of judges, including those nominated by President Donald J. Trump and confirmed by the Senate;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas following his decisive defeat in both the November Presidential election and legal efforts that followed, President Donald J. Trump, alongside more than 100 Republican Members of the House of Representatives and a dozen Republican Senators, announced their intent to object to the certification of the votes of certain States’ electors perpetuating baseless claims about the integrity of the election, and encouraged their supporters to descend on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, to <quote>stop the steal</quote>;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on the afternoon of January 6, 2021, a mob of thousands of domestic terrorists and seditionists engaged in a sustained effort to bypass United States Capitol Police and officers under direction of the Sergeants at Arms of the House and Senate in order to delay and disrupt Congress’ constitutional and statutory duty of certifying the 2020 Presidential election results;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the responding officers from the Sergeants at Arms of the House and Senate, United States Capitol Police, National Guard, and Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia were physically assaulted and threatened with deadly weapons and firearms;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the security preparations by these and other law enforcement agencies were inexplicably and dangerously inadequate to meet the clear and present threat posed to Members of Congress and individuals in the line of succession to the Presidency; and</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas as a result of this insurrection, two individuals were fatally wounded in the United States Capitol and many others were severely injured: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble><resolution-body style="traditional" id="HE023B19FF9E444E084B4FF025B314658"><section id="H1C6953B4A01E40A69BB8E16D1AEAE499" section-type="undesignated-section" display-inline="yes-display-inline"><enum/><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">That it is the sense of Congress that—</text><paragraph id="HEE6EDD9FDAD04DD09BA618185D9D7C58"><enum>(1)</enum><text>President Donald J.
